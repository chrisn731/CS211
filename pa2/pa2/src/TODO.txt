TODO for ESTIMATE
============================================

1. Clearly Label Matrix X and Y
	a) X is going to contain our training data house attributes and the 
	first col will be all 1's (this is due to Gauss-Jordan Elimination)

	b) Y is going to be our house prices that we obtain from the last column of
	training data.

2. Create Functions for:
	a) Multiply Matricies
	
	b) Transpose Matricies
	
	c) Invert Matrix
		-This will implement Gauss Jordan Elimination. See Documentation for more info.

3. Use functions of 2. to create a final Matrix W that will contain our Weights.

4. Profit.
